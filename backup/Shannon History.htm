					<td class="mainTextLocalInfo" width="552"><font size="2">In 
					June 1999, Basis Communications Corporation undertook an 
					extensive tour of locations in Europe and Ireland to select 
					a suitable European location. This was completed in August 
					when Basis Communications Europe Limited opened its EMEA 
					headquarters at the e-Com Centre in Ennis, Co. Clare. This 
					office provided business, Sales and Technical Support to 
					Basis Communications customers in Europe/Middle East and 
					Africa.</font><p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px">
					<font size="2">In January of 2000 this role was expanded, an 
					R&amp;D group was recruited and Basis moved to the Shannon Free 
					Zone. In the following months, the R&amp;D team was rapidly 
					expanded and charged with the development of software for 
					the “Thunder” Network Processor, and later, the “Monsoon” 
					network processor. These Network Processors (NP’s) were 
					among the first of their kind to be introduced to the 
					world-wide communications market and represented the most 
					advanced and technically innovative devices then available. 
					The software, developed at Shannon, included both low-level 
					firmware and some applications oriented towards certain key 
					vertical markets, including low-end residential gateway 
					network devices, communications set-top boxes and early ADSL 
					controllers. </font></p>
					<p><font size="2">In May 2000 Intel Corporation acquired 
					Basis Communications and Shannon continued to provide 
					software for the Monsoon (now renamed the IXP22X) Network 
					Processor. Plans were immediately put in place to increase 
					the size of the R&amp;D team and a number of new projects were 
					investigated</font></p>
					<p class="mainTextLocalInfo"><font size="2">During 2000, 
					Intel Communications Europe (as the Shannon site was now 
					renamed) began research on a new Network Processor. This was 
					a second generation device and many times more powerful than 
					the previous Monsoon Processor. The software for the device 
					was jointly developed between Intel Communications Europe 
					and a sister research and development facility (also part of 
					the Basis acquisition), in Westford, Massachusetts. The 
					Silicon design was carried out in Shannon. This exciting 
					collaboration resulted in the on-time launch of the IXP/425 
					Network Processor which was released worldwide in Q2, 2002 
					and which is manufactured by the Intel Ireland FAB in 
					Leixlip, Co. Kildare.</font></p>
					<p class="mainTextLocalInfo"><font size="2">In 2006, Intel 
					Communications Europe Ltd was renamed Intel Shannon Ltd. The 
					change has been made to more accurately portray the 
					diversity of activity on campus which is no longer solely 
					communications centric. We are striving to play our part in 
					making IA the architecture of choice in the communications, 
					embedded and storage market segments.</font></td>
